pluma 1.5.0
===========

  * Migration to GSettings and drop mateconf
    (All code is migrated, except pythonconsole plugin. The plugin works,
    except you cant configure it; the configurable things were command
    and error colors; this will be fixed migrating the plugin to Gir
    instead of python-gtk)
