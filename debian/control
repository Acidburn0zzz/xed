Description: generic text editor

 extending this basic functionality with other features not usually
 found in simple text editors. Xedit is a graphical application which
 supports editing multiple text files in one window (known sometimes as
 tabs or MDI).

 Unicode UTF-8 encoding in edited files. Its core feature set includes syntax
 highlighting of source code, auto indentation and printing and print preview
 support.

 includes support for spell checking, comparing files, viewing CVS
 ChangeLogs, and adjusting indentation levels.
